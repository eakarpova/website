Git is a console utility for tracking and maintaining a history of file changes in a project. It allows you to roll back a project to previous versions, compare, analyze and merge changes into a repository. A repository is a repository of code and its change history that is stored locally on your hard disk or on the Internet

## Basic Git commands:

  1. git init: create a new repository.
  2. git clone <URL>: clone an existing repository.
  3. git add <file>: add a file for a future commit.
  4. git commit -m "Comment": create a commit with a message.
  5. git push: send a commit to a remote repository.
  6. git pull: download changes from a remote repository.
    

## Additional resources:

For practice, you can use the free Git simulator: Learn Git Branching.
For a more in-depth look at Git, check out the official Git SCM documentation.

**Start by learning the basic Git commands, and then gradually expand your knowledge by following the "learn as you go" principle. Good luck with Git!**
